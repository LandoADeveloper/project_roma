                DOMESTIC WORKERS ARE THE UNSUNG HEROINES OF OUR CHILDHOODS AND FAMILIES. THEY ARE NANNIES, HOUSE CLEANERS, AND CARE WORKERS — MOSTLY WOMEN OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANTS. DESPITE THEIR IMPORTANT ROLES, THEIR WORK OFTEN GOES UNRECOGNIZED AND THEIR INDUSTRY UNREGULATED. TAKE ACTION AND HELP US SHIFT THE NARRATIVE.
